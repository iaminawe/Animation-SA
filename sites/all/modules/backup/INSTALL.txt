Installation Instructions
=========================

1. Copy the file "backup.module" (without the quotes) to the modules/ 
directory in your Drupal installation.

2. Enable the backup module from the modules page

3. Go into the "access control" page and make sure the "make backups"
permission is enabled for your user account. (You are logging into Drupal
as a user other than "admin", right?)

4. Click on "backup" in the administer menu to bring up the backup screen.
If everything is good (i.e. all programs can be found), then you will be
able to perform a backup.

NOTE: At this time, only MySQL is supported.
