Upgrading Pageroute from 4.7.x to a 5.x version
------------------------------------------------

Pageroute has been substantially improved for 5.x, so some things have changed.
Most things do only concern developers, who should look at API.txt for a 
documentation of the new API.

This document is about the changes, which are important and visible for users:

 * You can upgrade pageroute like any other module, remove the old files,
   add all new files and run your drupal's update.php.

 * Pageroute arguments changed!
   In 4.7.x the first pageroute argument was always interpreted as a user id and
   the second argument as a node id.
   I've changed the argument order for 5.x, so the first one is the node id and the
   second one the user id.
   So to go through the route as another user e.g. as user with the id 5, but without
   passing a node id just us the URL:
                                pageroute_url/0/5

   I've changed the argument's order, because of pageroute's future of a general
   node creation/edit tool. So working with nodes is becoming more important, so
   passing a node id will be used much more often than passing an user id!

 
 * The experimental pageroute_workflow module has been removed. If you haven't used it,
   nevermind. Otherwise have a look at the "States Module Integration", which is described
   in the README.
