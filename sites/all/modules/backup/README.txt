Backup Module
=============

I manage some Drupal-based websites for non-profits, and wanted to give
the non-technical people who run the organizations a way to back up their
data over the web, in case I get hit by a beer truck or something.

This module is pretty simple, it allows you to download a backup of your
Drupal DOCUMENT_ROOT and database over the web.
