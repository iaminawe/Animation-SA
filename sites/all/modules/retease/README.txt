Developer Module that assists with re-building the node teasers.

This is useful when the node filters are changed:
 * teaser length is changed
 * updating node filters, such as adding htmlcorrector module

This is often done when:
 * upgrading Drupal versions
 * importing client "alpha" sites that don't define the above correctly
