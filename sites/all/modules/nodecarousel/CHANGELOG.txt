Development:
 * Fixed problem with having javascript load at the bottom of the page - a non-drupal_add_js'd jquery
    call was causing it to crash in some instances.  Now that is handled using old school js.
 * Added ability for late-loading of carousels.  Instead of having to load on document.ready, there's
    a javascript function that you can call when you know that nodecarousel will be visible.
 * Made the jquery selectors that had shown the Loading... and switched on the <ul> more specific,
    which was needed when some nodecarousels would load on document.ready and others wouldn't.
 * Created a surrounding div, with an id of 'nc_wrapper_'.name of the carousel, to make theming easier.
 * Nodecarousel default theming now tries to find an image in the result of a node_load operation, 
    and displays that in the default theme.  Still overrideable with theme_nodecarousel_node.
 * Added various db_rewrite_sql calls throughout for better security.
 * Unpublished nodes are not displayed in carousels.
 * Now, if you have views installed, nodecarousel allows you to use a view you've established as a
    node source.
 * No longer depends on nodequeue to be used - instead, if nodequeue is not loaded, it will not
    be presented as an option.
 * #231461: Fixed problem with not all SQL table names being surrounded by {}.

NodeCarousel-5.x-1.0
 * This is the initial release of NodeCarousel.  Although this is a fully functional module, there are various improvements I intend to make to the code to widen it's
     functionality - and I'm sure there's a few bugs that will be found and need to be fixed.
