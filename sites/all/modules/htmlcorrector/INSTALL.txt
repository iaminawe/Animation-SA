Readme
------

This is an HTML correcting module. The filter scans the input and makes sure
all HTML tags are properly nested and closed.

Note: The filter only checks against basic syntax, not against the HTML
      specification. Non-existant tags or entities will pass as correct.
      


Installation
------------

1. Copy the htmlcorrector.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
   automatically detect it.

2. Enable the module in "administer" > "modules".

3. Go to "administer" > "input formats" and enable and configure the module
   for the desired input format(s).
